Social Media Sentiment Analysis
This project processes and analyzes over 10,000 tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK and Scikit-learn to perform sentiment analysis, achieving an accuracy of 85%. The insights are presented through clear visualizations, highlighting sentiment trends and customer feedback.

Installation and Setup
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:

nltk
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
wordcloud
joblib

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas wordcloud joblib

Additionally, download the necessary NLTK data for tokenization, stopwords, and lemmatization:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

Running the Project

Preprocess the data: Clean and prepare the tweet data by running the preprocessing script.
python src/data_preprocessing.py


Train the model: Build and evaluate the sentiment analysis model using the training script.
python src/model_training.py


Generate visualizations: Create plots and charts of the analysis results with the visualization script.
python src/visualization.py



Alternatively, you can explore the entire workflow in the Jupyter Notebook located at notebooks/sentiment_analysis.ipynb.
Data
The project uses a dataset of tweets and their corresponding sentiments. The dataset should be in CSV format with two columns: tweet and sentiment (labeled as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'). 

If you have your own dataset, place it in the data/ directory as raw_tweets.csv.
If not, you can use a sample dataset provided in data/sample_tweets.csv for demonstration.

Note: Due to privacy concerns, the full dataset of 10,000+ tweets is not included in this repository. You can collect your own data using the X API or other sources.
Methodology
Preprocessing
The tweets undergo the following preprocessing steps:

Cleaning: Removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form.
Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Modeling
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to classify the sentiments of the tweets. The model is evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics.
Visualization
The results are visualized using:

Bar Charts: To show the distribution of sentiments.
Word Clouds: To highlight common words in each sentiment category.

Results and Insights
The sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. Key insights from the analysis include:

The majority of tweets have a neutral sentiment, indicating a balanced discussion.
Positive tweets frequently mention words like "love," "great," and "amazing."
Negative tweets often include words like "hate," "terrible," and "disappointing."
